AlgoVision is an interactive visualizer tool designed to facilitate the learning and implementation of algorithms through engaging visual representations. Developed using Java, Swing, AWT, and JavaFX, the application showcases a variety of algorithms, including sorting algorithms (such as Quick Sort and Merge Sort), searching algorithms (like Binary Search), and data structures like stacks, queues, and priority queues. This project aims to enhance understanding by providing users with real-time visual feedback as they explore different algorithms and their underlying mechanics.

The application employs the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, ensuring a clear separation of concerns that enhances code maintainability and scalability. By structuring the application in this manner, modifications and future enhancements can be implemented with ease, allowing for an adaptable learning platform. Additionally, the use of multi-threading enables simultaneous processing of user interactions and algorithm visualizations, ensuring a smooth and responsive experience.

With a focus on user engagement, AlgoVision features a dynamic user interface that supports intuitive navigation and interaction. Users can actively manipulate parameters and observe how different algorithms function in real-time, fostering a deeper understanding of algorithmic principles. By integrating visualizations with interactive elements, AlgoVision serves as an invaluable resource for students and enthusiasts looking to master algorithmic concepts.
